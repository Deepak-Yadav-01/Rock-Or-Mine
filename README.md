# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

## Overview

This project implements a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either a rock or a mine using SONAR data. It utilizes the Logistic Regression Model for the prediction task. The system is designed to analyze SONAR data and classify objects based on their acoustic properties.

## Features

- Utilizes SONAR data for object classification.
- Implements a Logistic Regression Model for prediction.
- Provides accurate classification of objects as rock or mine based on acoustic signatures.
- Offers potential applications in underwater object detection and classification.

## Usage

1. Download the dataset containing SONAR data to your local machine.
2. Implement the Logistic Regression Model using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
3. Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Logistic Regression Model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using testing data and appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
6. Use the trained model to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on new SONAR data.
